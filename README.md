### **_Single-Page Application with vanilla JavaScript ?_**

---

- Front-end Web Application are all about single-page applications

  - **(Handling Data + displaying data in a user interface)**
  - **(User Interface needs to stay in sync with Data)**
  - **(Very hard problem to solve)**

**_(Problem with JS (jquery))_**

1. Requires lots of direct DOM manipulation and traversing (imperative) -> "Spaghetti code".

2. Data (state) is usually **stored in the DOM**, shared across entire app -> Hard to reason + bugs

### **Why do front-end framework exist**

1. JavaScript Front-end framework exist because ...

   - Keeping a user interface in sync with data is really hard and a lot of work is
   - (Front-end frameworks solve this problem and take hard work away from developers)
   - e.g. Angular | React | Veu | Laveral (Different Approaches, same goal)

2. They enforce a **"Correct"** way of structuring and writing code (Therefore contributing to solving the problem of "speghetti code".)

3. They give developers and teams a consistent way of building front-end applications.
